 **Shell-In-C**

Welcome to **Shell-In-C**, my personal project to create a **command-line shell** in **C**. This project is an initial attempt to explore and understand the inner workings of command-line interfaces and system programming.

### **Overview**

The main objective of this project is to enhance my skills in C programming while learning how shells function at a low level. Currently, the shell supports fundamental features such as:

- **External Command Execution**
- **Parameter Handling**
- **File System Navigation** (`cd` command)
- **Exit Functionality**
- **Error Management**

Though still in its early stages, this shell is designed to be expanded over time. Future updates will include support for built-in commands, signal handling, and other advanced features.

### **Core Features**

- **External Command Handling:** Execute commands from external programs.
- **Parameter Management:** Process arguments passed to commands.
- **cd Command:** Change directories within the shell.
- **Exit Command:** Exit the shell program safely.
- **Error Management:** Handle errors gracefully when commands fail.

### **Objectives**

- **Proficiency in C Programming:** Improve my understanding of C and system-level programming.
- **Learn Shell Internals:** Understand the fundamental operations behind command-line shells.
- **Gain Practical Experience:** Work with system calls, process management, and file system operations.
- **Create a Functional Shell:** Develop a simple yet functional command-line shell.

### **Future Plans**

- Add support for **built-in commands** (e.g., `echo`, `pwd`, etc.).
- Implement **signal handling** (e.g., handling CTRL+C, SIGTERM).
- Add **job control** and **background process management**.
- Improve error handling and support for more advanced system calls.



### **Contributing**

Suggestions, improvements, or new features are welcome! Feel free to open issues or create pull requests to help improve the project.

### **Additional Notes**

- The code is well-commented to assist with understanding the logic and functionality.
- This project is a **learning exercise**, so it's an ongoing work in progress.
- Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
